## What is CloneMA and why did I make it?
So CloneMA is a Clone of the famous lighting control system GrandMA. I made this because I was bored and because I wanted a bit of a challenge. So I started working on it (first as a joke) and it actually started to look really good. I decided to release it as open source project on github!
