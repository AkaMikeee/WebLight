# WebLight
Virtual DMX light console made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Why did I create this?
Mostly for fun. And to test some things I've always wanted to make. 


### FAQ
#### Will this ever turn into actual software that can actually control DMX lights?
Probably not. This is just a virtual console and creating actual software that could control DMX lights would be hard to create. I would love to do it, but I think it would be too hard. I might try it if this project gets a lot of attention.

#### Will you ever create an actual EXE of the virtual console?
Probably yes. I really want it to be a executable game/application. After I finished the Web version, I'll start working on an actual EXE.
